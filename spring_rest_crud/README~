This project is a sample Spring REST CRUD application which focuses on RESTful Spring Web Services. Following features are added: get list of employees, get employee by id, add new employee, delete an existing employee. Mysql database is used for this sample project. The database name is employee_db and the only table name is employee. SQL is also added with this project. Log4j is used to log the requests in a log file named app_log.log which will can be configured from the log4j.properties file including in this project. 

To test the services, I've used Advanced Rest Client Application, which is a popular REST client extension of Chrome browser.
